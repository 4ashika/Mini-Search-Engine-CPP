Artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of everyday life over the past decade.
It is being used to personalise social media feeds, spot friends and family in smartphone photos and pave the way for medical breakthroughs.
But the rise of chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta AI has been accompanied by concern about the technology's environmental impact, ethical implications and data use.

What is AI and what is it used for?
AI allows computers to process large amounts of data, identify patterns and follow detailed instructions about what to do with that information.
Computers cannot think, empathise or reason.
However, scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.
