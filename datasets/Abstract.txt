Abstract
This work comprehensively investigates the characteristic footprints of optimal
layer conguration and bandgap-gradient on the performance of CIGS-based
thin-lm solar cell (TFSC), by employing SCAPS-1D software. Our results
determine that the W-shaped bandgap prole yields the highest eciency, followed by back-graded, V-shaped and eventually front-graded bandgap gradient
across the vertically-stepped absorber layer. Our simulations yields a novel Cdfree [Al/FTO/SnS2/W-shaped stepped CIGS/V2O5/Ni] solar cell conguration
having a remarkable eciency of 32.49 %. Markedly, the stability of ungraded
CIGS-based TFSCs is more than its graded counterpart under the impact of
increasing defect density and operating temperature. The performance parameters of the graded CIGS TFSC having absorber layer thickness of 1.5 µm is
comparable to its ungraded equivalent having a lower absorber width of 1.3 µm.
Hence, our ndings uniquely demonstrates the greater potential of ungraded
absorber layer over its graded analogue in enhancing the cost-eectiveness and
device-lifetime of the CIGS-based TFSCs.
